# Intent Extractor and Permission Checker

This is a set of two command-line tools for extracting Android app manifest files from APK files and checking the intents and permissions used in the manifest file.

## Intent Extractor

This tool extracts the AndroidManifest.xml file from all APK files in a specified directory and saves the output to a JSON file. It requires `adbkit-apkreader` and `fs` npm packages.

### Usage

```lua
 .\intentExtractor.exe <path to apk folder> <path to output folder>
```

#### Example

```bash
(working directory) intentExtractor.js ./apks ./output
```

### Output

The extracted manifest files will be saved as JSON files in the output folder.

## Intents and Permissions Checker

This tool reads an Android app manifest JSON file and checks the intents and permissions used in the manifest file. It requires `json`, `csv`, and `os` Python modules.

### Usage

```lua
python intentsAndPermissions.py <input JSON path> <intents CSV path> <permissions CSV path> <output folder path>
```

#### Example

```bash
python intentsAndPermissions.py ./manifest.json ./intents.csv ./permissions.csv ./output
```

### Input

The input JSON file must be a valid Android app manifest file.

### Output

The tool outputs a JSON file containing two lists: permissions and intents. These lists contain all permissions and intents used in the input manifest file.
