## tar_extractor.py

This script is designed to extract `.tar.gz` archive files from a given source folder and save the extracted JSON files to a specified processed folder. Additionally, a processing report is generated, which includes the processing status for each file.

### Usage

The script is meant to be run directly, and it processes the banking data files located in the specified source folder.

### Functions

- `make_archive(source, destination, format='zip', input_name=None)`: Archives a folder and moves the archive file to a specified destination.
- `sort_report_alphabetically(report_file)`: Sorts the lines in a text file alphabetically.
- `extract_tar_gz_files(source_folder, processed_folder, report_file)`: Extracts all tar.gz archive files in a folder and saves their contents to JSON files.

## txt_splitter.py

This script is designed to split large text files into smaller text files with a specified number of lines per file.

### Usage
