## Brief Description of the Modules
1. Dissasembly of APK files
    - This module is used to dissasemble the APK files into DEX files. 
    - The dissasembly is done using the BakSmali.jar file.
    - It generates Opcodes and other information about the APK file in smali format.
    - Add Baksmali related stf here**

    - The dissasembled files are stored in the dissasembled folder.
2. DeObfuscation of APK files
    - This module is used to deobfuscate the dissasembled APK files.
    - The deobfuscation is done using a tool called simplify.
    - Simplify virtually executes an app to understand its behavior and then tries to optimize the code so that it behaves identically but is easier for a human to understand. Each optimization type is simple and generic, so it doesn't matter what the specific type of obfuscation is used.
    - [Further Reading](https://github.com/CalebFenton/simplify#optimization-strategies)
    - The deobfuscation can also be done be DeOptfuscator.
    - Deoptfuscator is a tool for deobfuscating Android applications that have been transformed using control-flow obfuscation mechanisms.
    Deoptfuscator can reverse the control-flow obfuscation performed by DexGuard on open-source Android applications.

    - Either way both of them produce optimized smali files.
    - The deobfuscated files are stored in the deobfuscated folder.
3. Reassembling of APK files
    - This module is used to reassemble the deobfuscated APK files into APK files.
    - The reassembling is done using the Smali.jar file.
    - It generates dex and other information about the APK file in c.lass format.
    - Add Smali related stf here**
    - The reassembled files are stored in the reassembled folder.
4. Feature Extraction
    - This module is used to extract the features from the reassembled APK files.
    - The features are extracted using the AndroPyTool.
    - Its tool for extracting static and dynamic features from Android APKs. It combines different well-known Android apps analysis tools such as DroidBox, FlowDroid, Strace, AndroGuard or VirusTotal analysis. Provided a source directory containing APK files, AndroPyTool applies all these tools to perform pre-static, static and dynamic analysis and generates files of features in JSON and CSV formats 
    - Currently, the features are extracted using the AndroPyTool. And only static features are extracted.
    - The features are stored as a csv file in the features folder.
5. Feature Selection
    - This module is used to select the features from the extracted features.
    - The features are selected using the Feature Selection module.
    - The generated features are Opcodes,API calls,Strings,API packages,System commands,Intents,Activities
    - [show case the files in ppt]
    - The unselected features are stored in the unselected folder. Which is not used for training the model.
    - The features are stored as a csv file in the features folder.
6. Dividing and preparing the data for Serving model
    - The data is modified into POST request format.
    - And data is cleaned.
7. Initialising the containers
    - The containers are initialised using the docker-compose.yml file.
    - All the containers are initialised.
    - Each container is assigned a port number.

8. Serving the model
    - The model is served using  a BASIC CURL request.
    - As each container is assigned a port number, the request is sent to the respective container.
9. Aggregating the results
    - The results are aggregated using the Aggregator module.
    - The results are stored in the results folder.
    - Weights are assigned to each container.
    - The results are aggregated using the weights.
10. Output class
    - The output class is used to display the results.
    - The results are displayed in the form of a table.
    - The table contains the name of the APK file, the predicted class.
